# Bars

I've lived in Belo Horizonte, or simply BH, for many years. BH is known in Brazil for being the 'city of bars'. Although I often dispute this claim, here are some of my favorite places:

### Café Cultura Bar

A great place to enjoy good food, good music and a relaxing environment

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/cafecultura.png" title="café cultura" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>


### Tim Academia de Bilhares

It would be a regular bar if it wasn't for the fact that it is pool/snooker bar that's open 24/7

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/sinuca.jpg" title="sinuca" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>


### Rei do Pastel

A bar that's open 24/7 with excellent prices. Couldn't find a good picture though

### Bar Dois Irmãos

The strongest capirinha you'll drink in BH

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/doisirmaos.jpg" title="Dois Irmãos" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

### Bola Bar

Open since 1939, it has good prices and great food.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/bolabar.jpg" title="Dois Irmãos" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

# Places to get coffee or grab a bite

### Comercial Sabiá 
located in the Mercado Central, is a great place to grab a bite and get some coffee. After you're done, walk around the Mercado and maybe buy some cachaça, cheese, or doce de leite.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/sabia.jpg" title="Comercial Sabiá" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/paodequeijo.jpg" title="Pão de Queijo" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/broa.jpg" title="Broa com Queijo" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

### Café Nice

Established in 1939, Café Nice is a traditional coffee shop in the heart of Belo Horizonte and it definitely deserves a visit. If you don't trust me, listen to the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory from the University of Illinois:


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/cafezinho.jpg" title="cafezinho" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

While you're there, try the plum pudding:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/cremeameixa.jpg" title="Creme de Ameixa" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

### Café Palhares

Established in 1938, Café Palhares is a good place to grab lunch and drink a beer (or cachaça) with friends. Their most famous dish is the Kaol, although I prefer the 'Cambito'.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/cambito.jpg" title="cambito" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

### Casa Alvorada

Another cool place to go with friends, try regional foods, great coffee, and even some signature drinks

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/alvorada.jpg" title="Casa Alvorada" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

# Others

Other places to consider visiting if you're around:

### Parque Municipal

A great park in the heart of the city. Additionally, if you go on a Sunday, you can also go the 'Feira Hippie', a sort of fair that happens every sunday in front of the park

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/parquemunicipal.jpg" title="parquemunicipal" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

### Praça do Papa

Offers a great view of the city from one of the highest points available

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/papa.jpg" title="papa" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

### Cine Belas Artes
One of my personal favorites: a movie theater that screens both mainstream and independent movies.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/belas.jpg" title="belas artes" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

</div>
