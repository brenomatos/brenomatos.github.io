I listen to many international artists, but I often argue that Brazilian music is the most diverse, unique and interesting there is. Our many great artists leverage their talent and the beauty of brazilian portuguese to create great tunes. Below is a non-exaustive list of some of my favorite brazilian albums:


- Getz/Gilberto - João Gilberto
    -  The record that popularized bossa-nova world-wide  
- Alucinação - Belchior
    - Many themes, including dictatorship in Brazil
- Músicas Para Churrasco Vol.2 - Seu jorge
    - Throw a barbecue with your friends
- Zeca Apresenta: O Quintal do Pagodinho - Zeca Pagodinho feat. many artists
    - Three different albums of high quality samba with some of our greatest sambistas
- Fé na Festa - Gilberto Gil
    - Pays homage to some of Forró's greats
- Sobrevivendo ao Inferno - Racionais MC's
    - Raw, seminal brazilian rap album.

- África Brasil - Jorge Ben Jor
    - Jorge Ben Jor's work spreads through decades, adding new themes, layers and sounds. He is so great that [Rod Stewart copied him](https://happymag.tv/rod-stewart-stole-do-ya-think-im-sexy/)

    - Delicate, thoughtful, original.
