This post briefly describes the internship 

## Application process

The application process is pretty straightforward. You'll need a statement of purpose and your grade records. The internship is open only to B.Sc. and M.Sc. students. You can apply [here](https://summer.epfl.ch/). It is definitely worth it to apply (not only to this internship but others as well).

### Visa
If you're not from an EU country, you'll need a visa. But the EPFL staff will help with this.

## Research

I had the opportunity to be an intern at the Data Science Lab under prof. Robert West. I worked on a project with Manoel, one of his PhD students, on simulating user sessions on YouTube with bots. The bots would watch either random videos or videos from a curated list. Before and after each video, we would scrape the bot's homepage to get the list of recommended videos. The idea was to understand if YouTube's recommender algorithm was guilty of pushing videos with certain topics (e.g., far right content) to users or not.
